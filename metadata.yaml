description: The Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece and Rome had returned to Earth
  -- with all their awesome powers intact. Overnight, Earth was transformed. War on
  any scale was outlawed, along with boom-and-bust economic cycles, and prudery. No
  change was more startling than the face of New York, where the Empire State Building
  became the Tower of Zeus. In this totally altered world, William Forrester is an
  acolyte of Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, and a teacher of history. Only Maya Wilson,
  one of his students and a worshipper of Venus, Goddess of Love, had a different
  sort of grading in mind. Maya is the first of the many Trials of Forrester, every
  bit as mighty and perilous as the Labors of Hercules.
